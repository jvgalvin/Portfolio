# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to build classifiers that could determine if a sales opportunity would be won.

# Date
This project was completed in March 2021.

# Context
I conducted this project to "dip my toes" in machine learning. This was the first machine learning project I undertook.

# Data
I used data that is confidential and not available publicly. Certain cells have deliberately been exlcuded to protect confidentiality.

# Tools Used
I performed this analysis locally within Jupyter Notebook.

# Top Line Summary
A logistic regression, random forest classifier, and a support vector machine only do slightly better than pure chance performance at determining if a sales opportunity will close. Precision and recall metrics are much better for the negative class than the positive one.

# Lessons Learned
If I were to do this project again, I would:
  * Attempt to balance classes, as there are many more negative cases than positive ones
  * Investigate engineering additional features
  * Use a single script to preprocess data and import a preprocessed file in individual notebooks instead of redoing the preprocessing in each notebook
  * Further experiment with hyperparameters
