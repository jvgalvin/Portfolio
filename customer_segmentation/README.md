# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to discover naturally-occurring clusters of existing customers in an effort to use this information to target prospective customers in a former sales role. I acknowledge that (a) several variables are omitted, (b) global economic conditions changed just prior to when this anlaysis was conducted as a result of COVID-19, and (3) the existence of a customer with certain parameters is not necessarily predictive of closing a prospective one with similar measurements on the same parameters.

# Date
This project was completed in February 2021.

# Context
This was a self-inspired project that I identified and completed to make more efficient use of my time in a former sales role.

# Data
The data used was and is not publicly avaialable and several cells have been removed or redacted to protect confidentiality. The data came from Salesforce.

# Tools Used
I performed this analysis locally within Jupyter Notebook.

# Top Line Summary
This analysis debunked the commonly-told sales trope of aiming for very large prospects. It also revealed that match scores provided by enrichment tools should not be the sole indicator of which accounts to target.
