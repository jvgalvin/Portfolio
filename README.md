# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain experience / practice with object-oriented design priciples within Python.

# Context
* Cooking is fun, can be healthy, and is highly social. Figuring out what to cook, however, is not (at least for me).
* This program has 4 different modes to speed up the menu selection process:
  * “GUIDED” - the program will guide the user through selection of a cocktail, appetizer, main course, and dessert based on the user’s preferences
  * “RANDOM” - the program will choose a cocktail, appetizer, main course, and dessert at random
  * “MOOD” - the program asks the user to enter a mood (casual or sophisticated) and selects a cocktail, appetizer, main course, and dessert which each match that mood
  * “OCCASION” - the program asks the user to enter an occasion (dinner with friends, date night, weeknight, or dinner party) and selects a cocktail, appetizer, main course, and dessert which each match that occasion

# Data
Although the recipes are not my own, they are some of my favorites. I personally assembled and structured the 4 csv files.

# Tools Used
I performed this analysis locally within Jupyter Notebook.

# Instructions for Using the Menu Builder
  * Download the 4 csv files (Cocktail, Appetizer, MainCourse, and Dessert) to a directory
  * Download the menu.py file and place it in the same directory as the 4 csv files
  * From the Terminal window, run ‘python menu.py’ or ‘python3 menu.py’
  * The program will automatically open 4 windows in your default browser after it runs to bring you to the webpages with the recipe and directions for each dish on your menu
