# Summary of Project

This is an individual project that I completed as part of the course Fundamentals of Data Engineering, a core course for UC Berkeley's MIDS program. The goal of the project was to gain experience connecting to a SQL database, writing SQl queries, and visualizing data from these queries in a business user-friendly format. The output of this project is a series of recommendations for a fictional business, all of which are derived from data.

## Tools Used

I used a PostgreSQL database comprised of several tables containing synthetic sales and product data for a fictional meal prep and delivery business. I adopted a function written in Python from a lab I completed during this course to connect to the database and write and execute the queries required. For subsequent manipulation, I utilized Pandas and visualized plots using Matplotlib.

## Environment

I completed this project exclusively from a VM running on AWS within a docker cluster of anaconda and postgres containers. I used a Jupyter Notebook server within this cluster to work within the notebooks contained in this repository.

## How to Read Files in this Repository

The Jupyter Notebooks contained within this repository should be read / viewed in order, from 1 through 6. The first 3 notebooks contain purely queries and visualizations, while the last three contain queries, data manipulation, visualizations, executive summaries, and recommendations.
