# Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis
### Context and Objective
March 2021 marked one year after my return to the Bay Area. My interest in further developing programming skills was growing and I thought an analysis of my former home cityâ€™s peer-to-peer housing market would offer me an opportunity to practice some Pandas and data visualization basics. The objective of this project was to quantify the extent to which Airbnb listings changed during the first year of Covid-19.
