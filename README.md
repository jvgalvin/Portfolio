## Objective

### Recommend meal-pick up locations and delivery methods to expand business for the AGM Berkeley location.

## Our Hybrid Approach

### BART is used to transport supply to pick-up locations. Pick-up locations are established at select BART stations. Customers can pick up their orders in person from these BART Pick-Up locations. For an additional fee, customers can have their orders delivered from the Pick-Up location to anywhere whithin a 1.5 mile radius. 

## Suitability Criteria for Potential Pick-Up Location

### 1) Population within 1.5 miles of the BART station. 

### 2) The BART station's centrality measure of betweeness. 

### 3) The travel time from the AGM Berkeley location's local BART station (Ashby). 

### 4) No overlaping drone-delivery areas among the chosen pick-up locations.

## Implementation

### Phase One - Establish four BART pick-up locations. Two of these will offer drone delivey service. 

### Phase Two - If current drone-delivery service locations show significantly higher customer traffic, then expand drone-delivery service to all locations. 

### Phase Three - After analysis of current customer base, consider establishing more BART pick-up location in areas outside current drone-delivery service.
