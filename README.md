# Summary of Project

The goal of this project was to gain additional experience connecting to a SQL database, writing SQl queries, and visualizing data from these queries in a business user-friendly format. Moreover, I gained experience creating staging tables in PostgreSQL, parsing JSON, loading data into PostgreSQL, and validating data once it was loaded to staging tables. Like my "query_functional_programming" project, the output of this project is a recommendation for a fictional business, which was derived from synthetic data.

# Date

This project was completed in February 2022.

# Tools Used

I used a PostgreSQL database comprised of several tables containing synthetic sales and product data for a fictional meal prep and delivery business. I adopted functions written in Python from a lab I completed during this course to connect to the database, write and execute the queries required, and recursively print the contents of a JSON file. For data validation, I made use of fuzzy logic. For subsequent manipulation, I utilized Pandas and visualized plots using Matplotlib.

# Environment

I completed this project exclusively within a VM running on AWS within a docker cluster of Anaconda and PostgreSQL containers. I used a Jupyter Notebook server within this cluster to work within the notebook contained in this repository.
