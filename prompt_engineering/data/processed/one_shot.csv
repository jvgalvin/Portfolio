Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?   Tom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?   Diana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.   Tom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.   Diana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.   Tom: Thank you! This is a great advice!   Tom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.   Diana: How many rooms are you looking for?

Tom: At least £300 000, it's in a very good condition, good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago.   Diana: Could you please send me some pictures?

I could barely keep the smile off my face.   Tarquin: But it's really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.   Quentin: Yes, that's probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese.
