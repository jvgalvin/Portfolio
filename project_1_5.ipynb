    "The RFM model is one of the most widely-used methods to segment an organization's customer base. The \"best\" customer is one who purchased a product relatively recently, purchases frequently, and spends a relatively high total amount of money with the organization. These customers are ones who could potentially pilot / test new products before they are launched and who ought to serve as the target market for such new products.\n",

These customers should be engaged, too, but for the purpose of (a) figuring out why they haven't made a purchase recently and (b) attempting to salvage the customer before they are lost.\n",

We could then use these clusters/groupings to inform our approach to growing our relationship with them. This model could be reformed / rerun at specific time intervals to reflect changes in our customer base as our business grows."
