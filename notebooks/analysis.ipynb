I had mine stolen last month around when I parked around on the 9th street    Ray: Mine was there too :( cops said it's a common area for it to happen but I still havent lost hope :(    Scott: Did they check the security cameras around the place? Maybe Mariott people saw someone?    Ray: Apparently they don't overlook that area...     Luke: Yeah, cops were completely useless too, I ended up going to Mariott on my own and asking people but they didn't see anything. I emailed their manager if they could look at the tapes but because of privacy issues blah blah blah it was a no go... Good luck man!    Ray: I mean those guys are pros... I had high grade lock on mine and an app alert and it didn't do shit. Now I'm out few grand and pissed off    Scott: I would be too. Did you post posters in the area? it's a busy street so maybe someone saw something    Ray: Yeah, I'm getting around to it now and I really hope that smeone was sober enough to notice anything. I mean it's a custom bike so I hope if they try to get rid of it it will rise suspicion    Luke: I think it might ve already been turned into parts and shipped off. Even if you wanted to keep it and painted it, you could still recognize it    Ray: I know, that's why I wanna reach as many people as posible,maybe they ll get spooked and leave it somewhere    Sam: Let us know if you need someone to go dumpster diving with     Ray: Heh, thx Sam!

      "Roger: When you're laying tile how many rows can/should you do in a day?    Jim: Floor?    Roger: walls    Dan: which mortar are you using?    Roger: pre-mixed. seems like it dries very slowly    Jim: Why would it matter how long it takes to dry? Only takes a day to be able to grout with the pre mix. You can do as many rows as you like also.    Roger: Right o. I just didn't know if they would shift around with more rows stacked on them?    Dan: <file_photo> you just make a level ledger (2nd row). Mark a center line on all walls then see where the last tile is going to be on sides and ceilings. You do the bottom row closest to the shower pan last after the ledger row dries.    Jim: Exactly, don't do the bottom row 1st, for some reason makes getting everything to line up pretty difficult. And push everything flat on the tile with a level so it looks good.    Roger: Okay, good to know. I was just going to start at the bottom and work my way up    Dan: Might not work. Shower pans are usually not level so everything will end up off.    Jim: Do you have a digital level? I can give you mine if you need    Roger: I have a digital one.    Jim: Ok cool.    Dan: Good luck. Let us know if you need anything.\n",

Melissa: We have already booked the same holiday apartment on Lake Constance we stayed in before. Peter is quite sentimental about it.    Loreen: No, we do not really care about it.

Loreen: In Cuba, I think. But it's not sure yet where exactly. We'll have to do our bookings soon, as we'll probably have no internet there.    Melissa: That's bad! How many weeks in Cuba?    Loreen: 4 Long, eh?    Melissa: Not when you're travelling around. Are you going to rent a car again?    Loreen: No, not in Cuba. Too much hustle. They are said to have cheap and good public transport. Car rentals have rather prohibitive prices.    Melissa: Oh is that so? I thought everything is cheap there.    Loreen: Dunno yet. We'll see. What's the time your end?    Melissa: 2:18 pm It must be early morning in Mexico now.    Loreen: 8:12. We'll soon be going down for breakfast. Have a nice afternoon Melissa!

      "Tom: Good afternoon. I have received your contact details from my colleague Anna.    Diana: Hello Tom, it's good to hear from you. Anna told me you will be in touch. How can I help you?    Tom: Actually, there are two things. First of all, my wife and I are looking for a flat. At the same time we want to sell our old flat.    Diana: I understand. Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?    Tom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?    Diana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.    Tom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.    Diana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.    Tom: Thank you! This is a great advice!    Tom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.    Diana: How many rooms are you looking for?    Tom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.    Diana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?    Tom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.    Diana: Thank you. What's your current budget?    Tom: We were thinking about £400 000. Would it be possible?    Diana: I think so. Would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated?    Tom: It depends on how much we can sell our flat for.    Diana: How much are you aiming for?    Tom: At least £300 000, it's in a very good condition, good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago.    Diana: Could you please send me some pictures? I would also gladly make an appointment with you.    Tom: That would be perfect!    Diana: Would Monday at 8 be acceptable?    Tom: Hm, I need to consult it with my wife, but so far it's all right.\n",

      "Quentin: Are you coming to the unboxing tonight?     Tarquin: Have you had another delivery, then.    Quentin: Yes indeed. And as usual I have no idea what they have sent me.    Tarquin: Did you make an event on Facebook?    Quentin: Yes I did. You didn't see it?    Tarquin: I haven't been on for a few days. Actually I got a ban for making a joke which offended someone. It involved a penguin, which as you know can be a very offensive topic.    Quentin: I don't know. People today as so sensitive, but are ignorant anyway.    Tarquin: So will you have a good crowd for the unboxing?     Quentin: Only seven for definite. I will do some wine and cheese and we can start opening the boxes at 8pm    Tarquin: Sounds great. I will turn up.     Quentin: Great.    Tarquin: How many books do you think there will be?    Quentin: About 200, like the other time.    Tarquin: how many did you sell on the spot?     Quentin: Only 30, the rest went into the shop. But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.    Tarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige.     Quentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.    Tarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?    Quentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.    Tarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?    Quentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.    Tarquin: But it's really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.    Quentin: Yes, that's probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.    Tarquin: Yes. That's from Peter's company right?    Quentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special \"Quentin price\" only on the evening of the unboxing. I'll be doing that tonight as well if you want anything for Christmas wine-wise.\n",

That's correct and the cottage is easy to find. Actually I'll be going there myself in an hour, so the simplest way will be that I'll send you Share My Location from there to your Whatapp. It will work then as a map. Would that be fine?    Liz: Thank you, that should do the trick. But to be on the safe side, can we have the address too?Just for our car navigation.    Laurien in Buxton: Yes of course but it won't be to much avail. All navigation systems fail to find it I'm afraid. But I'll give the name of my local pub, it's only 3,6 miles away from my cottage. The Kings Table on Quarnford, Buxton SK17 0SN. Once you are there, head for Wildboardclough, it's signposted, and you are soon on the map.    Liz: Well it still sounds complicated but we'll give it a try. Do you think we may ask for directions in the pub?    Laurien in Buxton: By all means! Just mention Oldhagsboards to the publican and he'll give you precise directions. He's my nephew and I'll tell him that you'll be coming.    Liz: Splendid! I don't think we'll manage before dark though.    Laurien in Buxton: As long as you're in the pub before last orders, it's alright :))    Liz: And a pint at the end of a long drive will be welcome too! Thank you Laurien.    Laurien in Buxton: You'll be alright. And don't hesitate to contact me if you need something. I usually reply within half an hour.    Liz: Very kind of you. Thank you!\n",

Heather: Ok, but there are so many religions out there. And of course there are agnostics, atheists, etc.    Barry: You just have to follow your heart. If you're searching for something, God will point you in the right way. At least that's what I think. Personally, the Bible aligns with my perception of morality. The Bible is like a guidebook for our lives. The more you follow it's principles, the better your life will be, and you'll be blessed by God.    Heather: If the Bible is so right, then why are there just as many muslims?    Barry: I can't answer that question. God has a plan for this world, and sometimes we just have to accept the fact that we can't know all the answers. I put my faith in God and the Bible. I'm sure you must have a Bible lying around. Start reading it and God will surely speak to you. And if you're interested, you can always come to my church. If you need some encouragement, there are some pretty nice single guys :)    Heather: Oh come on. I'm not gonna go to church to meet Mr. Right.    Barry: Why not? It's the perfect place to meet a life partner, and I'm being serious.

      "Dave: It's curious how of all religions ever created it was Christianity that conquered the world    Lukas: It's simple.

Lukas: In the end it's the matter of power and influence.    Dave: But why did Christianity happen to be present in strongest civilizations?    Lukas: Religion was once closely connected to ruling over a country.    Lukas: Religious leaders had much more to say than court members.    Lukas: So it was obvious that expansion towards foreign lands mean that culture of conquered state should be banished and replaced by culture of aggressor.

I loved going there as a kid.     Ralph: Good beer? :D    Felix: LOL, no idea, but the music was awesome. We slept in a room just above the main one, so even though we were sent to beds early, we still could hear all the singing. And some of these songs were even less suitable for kids our age than beer :D    Agnes: People knew how to have fun back then, didn't they? :)    Brittany: And we don't?    Agnes: Not in the same way. I sort of wish it was still common to sing at work. It makes many tasks less mundane.

Steven: Come on. If you want to avoid cancer causing things, you should move to the jungle on a different planet and wear a space suit.    Steven: On this list you sent there is UV radiation causing cancer.     Steven: Meaning that literally the daylight can make you sick.     Betty: It's about long-term exposure.    Steven: Yup. Generally spending time outside in summer gives you cancer.    Betty: Don't neglect scientific reasearch.    Steven: I'm not. But I just think life is too short to get paranoid over everything    Steven: I fully support fighting with smoking in public places, convincing people to quit smoking, start diverse diet and avoid unhealthy food.    Steven: But I'm honestly surprised that scientist devote so much time to analyze what and how causes cancer, and there is still no certain cure for it.    Steven: The more we study world, the more substances we analyze, and the more we analyze the more conclusions we have.    Steven: So in near future we might learn that literally everything causes cancer because that's how the world was programmed     Betty: I'm no radical paranoic Steve I'm just saying, that if you don't have to expose yourself to additional risk, then don't do it.\n",

David: Damn, not really fair in my opinion    Victor: No, not really. I was looking for a different gym, but all of them are too far away    David: I have the same problem, I'd love to show them they can fuck off with those prices, but I'd probably spend the same commuting further away    David: I think I'll stay, but if they raise the prices once again I simply won't be able to afford it ;/    Victor: Same here, man.

Very pleasant indeed.    Resa: If you were staying with us, I image you'd be in the pool all the time.    Carol: Sure I would. Are you?    Resa: No. You know me.    Resa: Bill saw the ENT doc today. He will have an MRI scan soon to determine if he has growths on the ear nerves.    Carol: What?! What does it mean?    Carol: Any suspicion of spreading????    Resa: No, the doc says these are usually benign.    Carol: Thank goodness for that.    Resa: And slow growing, but the damage to the nerve is the issue.    Carol: Has he got any hearing problems?    Resa: I'm frustrated because everything Bill has suffered from, I've asked him to seek medical attention and he's declined. So he's suffering now (and am I) from lack of preventive care.    Carol: Typical male. Thomas is not different.    Carol: Of course the partner suffers along, sometimes even more.    Resa: So true...    Resa: It's bad Carol. We cannot hold a decent conversation. He can no longer watch television.    Carol: That really sounds awful. So sorry for you.    Carol: And what about hearing aids? Also refused??    Carol: But he loved television so much!    Resa: Another challenge to deal with.    Resa: Hearing aid will come once the cause of deafness is diagnosed.    Carol: My mother in law had a pair of earplugs connected to the TV set via Bluetooth, so she could walk around her room and still hear tv.    Carol: I mean the technology is there to grab it.    Resa: Yes, that's  a fantastic option.    Resa: We'll go that route soon I'm sure.    Carol: You are a very brave and strong woman Theresa!    Resa: Thank you dear. I know I'm strong.

They are a load of slave drivers there! It's not so bad in Samuel's, just busy days and one late night till 8pm. I quite enjoy it here, actually.

Got a 7 hour shift then though, so can't have any kind of hangover!     Jenny: God, it does suck a bit, but at least you're earning a decent wage.    Beth: Yes, I suppose so and we do have a profits share scheme so there are bonuses. But no work/life balance to speak of.😢    Jenny: Do you think you'll get taken on in the New Year?    Beth: Umm, don't know. I've not missed a day, had my pay docked only once for being 5 mins late! I'm frankly not sure if I would want the job, mind you.    Jenny: Yes, I'd think very carefully about the pros and cons first!    Beth: Yes, I'm going to look around, check Indeed, Reed, etc, other job sites.     Jenny: I'll keep my ear to the ground, see what's around in town, it would be nice to work near each other!    Beth: Yes, it would! Thanks love, let's meet for coffee one day at least.

They only tend to put fire under subjects such as immigration and other stigmatized and attacked groups, and not real problems. Nobody cares about the economy or human rights    Pam: Yeah, I think there are more unconsious people nowadays because of tabloidisation of the whole media world. We read short-themed news, that are so well prepared to cause different type of strong emotions.     Sam: Hm, I really see no solution to that. I am afraid, that the fake news industry is only set to gain meaning in the today’s world of internet. It would be really hard to prosecute for spreading falsehood, before it really gets a bigger meaning and recognition.    Pam: Yes, it would be impossible. Under current circumstances less and less people read longer forms, such as books, reports or reportages.

Gill: 25    Leanne: Then two is not that big of a deal.    Gill: Yeah, I guess, but that's just the two that I know of. There's probably more.    Leanne: You worry too much about this. Who cares if your grade is not an A+?    Gill: Well, I care and I was hoping for an A, but that's kinda out of the question now.    Leanne: You get As like all the time, so a one-time B won't change much for you.    Gill: I guess...\n",

Anne: Thanks a lot! I was thinking about Angelo's as well, but it happens that my cousin is Italian so I think it may be a bit risky to impress him with an Italian restaurant ;)    Carl: Fair point. What about Toff's? They are famous for having the best fish and chips in the UK.    Anne: Haven't heard about them! Where are they?    Carl: Third zone, near Highgate. The area is beautiful, really worth going, especially if someone's never been to London.    Sarah: If you're looking for something more central, I highly recommend Yori. It's a Korean restaurant, a true gem <3    Anne: What are the prices? It's not that we are really on a budget here, but wouldn't mind saving some for more touristic stuff ;)    Sarah: Cool, I find Yori affordable and their prive-value is really high in my opinion.    Carl: Same for the Toff's, they mainly sell fish and fish and chips, so maybe check with your cousin if he likes it first.    Anna: Oh, I bet he'd love to have an Instagram worthy photo with a fish and chips in London, hahaha!    Tom: If I were you, I'd focus on the bars more ;) Take him to Soho, skip the fancy ones though.    Anna: That goes without a question! Have a few places in mind already. He also has a sweet tooth, so I was thinking maybe Hummingbird?    Sarah: I think I may be joining you for that one! If not, take the salted caramel for my sake.    Anna: Always! I always go for the red velvet, even if Tom thinks it's overrated.    Tom: Because it is, it's just a normal cake with red dye in it.    Sarah: So Tom is definitely not going to Hummingbird with us :D Party pooper :P    Carl: How long is your cousin staying?    Anna: Four days so that's four lunches/dinners - waiting for your recommendations!    Tom: Hm... I would also suggest street food on Brick Lane or Borough's Market - if a party pooper may have something to say :P    Sarah: But never on a weekend! Unless you fancy getting stomped or like to waiting for your food like FOREVER. When is he coming?    Anna: Thursday to Sunday, so Thursday after flight it is then. Fortunately, he's flying in the morning. Thank you so much guys!    Carl: Our pleasure, as long as you bring us come cupcakes on Monday :D    Sarah: Yeah, three red velvets for Tom :P\n",

Lena: It seems to me that the notes are a bit sparse and don't really explore the underlying issues.    Simon: I've always found them perfectly adequate.    Lena: Yes, but Simon, I've had several kids come to be this term asking for clarification of various points, they really don't understand some parts of the scheme of work.    Simon: Really? That's news to me, I've had no complaints.    Lena: I mean, you can be a bit intimidating, Simon and they are still quite young.    Simon: Lena, I've been teaching for 30 years now, no discipline issues and very few problems, if I'm honest.    Lena: Well yes, and I respect your knowledge and experience, but none of us is totally perfect!    Simon: OK, I suppose if the kids have complained, it can't be totally comprehensible.

Simon: Well, OK, I suppose I can be a bit casual and slapdash sometimes, I lack your vigorous approach!

It’s not too sunny, which is a good thing, and you know what oppressive weather is doing to my health. The people are very hospitable and warm, but maybe a little bit too exuberant for my taste.    Camilla: And how is food?    Marge: Spicy and stodgy, but Frank is crazy about it. He’s forcing me to accompany him on every little trip to the city centre, so he can taste something new.    Camilla: You shouldn’t complain so much about it, Marge. After all, you are finally spending some quality time together.    Marge: Oh, but you know me. I’m more of a home bird, not that I’m staying in the hotel, mind you. Instead of chasing after food, I prefer to lounge in the sun with a good book in my hand. And he’s making my life just a little bit harder. But enough about me! How are you?    Camilla: Fine, thank you. I’m completely alone today, because Harry has gone fishing this morning, but I think I might go out for a bit, maybe do some shopping. We don’t have any rosemary and it does wonders to a freshly caught salmon. We’ll stay in touch, dear. Enjoy your trip!    Marge: We certainly will! Take care, dear.\n",

That's a lot!    Melissa: I know, but there are good reasons for that    Melissa: waiters get paid very badly in NYC    Jay: if they get paid at all    Melissa: exactly    Alan: what?    Melissa: it's said that nowadays a lot of business owners don't pay waiters because they assume they would get tips    Jay: and of course they don't have health insurance and so on, very often    Jay: so conditions of this work are very bad generally    Alan: So we basically chip in their salary?

Yvonne: He does but quite unlikely he's got it on him. Could you please check if it is on its key hook?    Iona: I'm already on the train to B'ham.    Yvonne: Oh blast!!! I guess I have to leave the key with the neighbours and put a note for him on the door. I'd hate him standing in the cold and dark here and not knowing what's going on.

I have this weekend free, so you buy the beers and I can be there bright and early Sat.    Nick: Cool, hey thanks a lot, man.    Jerry: No problem. Do you want me to bring something to eat?    Nick: We can have burgers on the barbecue. I may have some in the freezer.    Jerry: Ok, just let me know if you need me to bring anything.    Nick: If you have some tools, that'd be great.     Jerry: Yeah, I'll bring my electric saw.    Nick: Ok, great! See you Sat.    Jerry: No problem, take care.\n",

David: it’s not what you’re thinking! Promise!    Sarah: i don’t want to go into details but we have to leave her :( it’s breaking my heart! Believe me!    Sarah: Just to let you know our gorgeous cat’s going to a new home with lovely people.    David: Such great news!    Sarah: So sad but also relieved she’s going to a lovely new home.\n",

But I'll ask for you. What's the matter?    Phil: They are not aligned and it is very disturbing at night.     Andrew: Can't you go to the authorised service centre? They should fix it immediately.    Phil: Do you know how much they charge?    Andrew: No and probably I don't want to know.    Phil: You don't. Anyway, can you recommend anyone?    Andrew: Not off the top of my head.    Phil: Ok. Let me know if some name springs to your mind.    Andrew: I will. Besides that, everything is ok?    Phil: Yes, it seems so :-)    Andrew: By the way, are authorised service centres really that expensive?    Phil: You can't even imagine! For a small stupid thing they usually charge three times more than other garages.    Andrew: Wow...    Phil: That's why whenever I can I try to avoid them.    Andrew: Now I see. Anyway, I'll be thinking about your lights. In the meantime take care!    Phil: Thanks. Take care too!\n",
      "Julia: Hi! I don't know if you remember me, but we'll probably meet for the New Year's. I was just talking with my friends (Alex Rafferty and Natalie Simpson), with whom I'm arriving with, whether there is an option to not take part in the activitiy with the costumes, and just take part for the rest of the party. I'm sorry if it's an inconvenience.    Aurore: Hello... hmmm, well the initial plan was to start with the costumes and that will definitely take over an hour. Of course, there will be other dances and games, but that was ment to be the main event... Are you sure you don't want to take part?    Aurore: I'm sorry that I haven't sent you the descriptions of your characters, but I can quickly summarise what part each of you would play (even for Natalie)... What exactly do you not like in this activity?    Aurore: Okay, you know what - I've thought things through. I won't send you your character descriptions - I guess while that event is taking place, you'll have to be next door (there are board games & films, so you should be entertained). Then, when the costume activity has ended (which I would like to point out, doesn't depend on me but on the participants of said activity), you can rejoin us.    Julia: Well, we don't exactly understand what the game is... Is it something similar to charades?    Aurore: No!! Absolutely not!!! I wrote a detailed description of the game a while back, let me see if I can resend you the email.    Aurore: <file_other>    Julia: Wow, it looks really cool! :) I'll try to convince the girls to stay.    Aurore: That's the thing - because of so many changes: people signing up at the last minute, other people cancelling, not to mention the nature of this game and how close it is to the new years, I don't have time to send you detailed descriptions of your characters until new year's eve, which might not be enough time for you to prepare.    Julia: Oh, in that case - we'll stay by the board games. I'm sorry for all the trouble we've caused you and thank you for explaining everything.    Aurore: It's okay (nature of the job, I suppose). But are you sure? Because like I wrote earlier, I do have characters for you if you like.    Julia: We're sure. Thank you! The game sounds amazing!\n",

Mia: A pint at Kelly's is fine.    Eric: You’re a pain 😂    Mia: I needed a pit stop. But really, there is absolutely no one around... I've never seen the city so empty!    Taylor: Everyone is at the NI game 😉    Mia: Thanks for the support guys...    Taylor: Definitely go to Fibbers!

How are you?    Pat: I'm very well! I haven't seen you girls in about 35 years! I left in 84, we went to run a pub, me and Jonathan.    Sandra: Well, you'll never believe it, but Brenda Riley tracked me down like this and we met up last weekend! We thought we might get the old Lister's gang together for a reunion, you know, before we're all too old!    Pat: You're not too old, you were all young girls out of school then!    Sandra: Yes, but that was almost 50 years ago, Pat! We're all grannies now!    Pat: Not me, we never had kids, our choice!    Sandra: You have no regrets, then?    Pat: Bit personal, dear! No, we retired from the pub 10 years ago, mid-60s, me and Jon have had a ball, cruises, safaris and I've seen my sister in Oz and my brother in Thailand several times.    Sandra: Oh Pat, that sounds lovely! My husband's still working, but we're planning a special trip to the US in a year or two. Can't wait! He's 66, and has had enough!    Pat: So, apart from Bren, you found any others?    Sandra: There was Betty Davies, but she was about 60 when the factory closed in 94, long time ago, if she's alive, I don't suppose she's on Facebook at 84 or something!    Pat: No, I suppose not, but you never know! I heard Marigold had passed away, you know, the supervisor?    Sandra: Yes, very sad, not long after Lister's closed, I think.    Pat: Ok, what about that young girl who loved David Bowie, joined us in about 73, only about 16 she was, I think. She always tried to match his current look, you remember when she did Ziggy Stardust with ginger hair and no eyebrows!    Sandra: Oh yes, Amanda Johnson, she was even younger than me and Brenda! She's still over 60 now though! She may well be on Facebook, did she get married, do you remember?    Pat: Not sure, could be tricky tracking all these down, so many common names!    Sandra: Oh yes, Magda Zielinski was in our section too! Maybe an easier name to find. Her mum was Polish, I think.    Pat: Oh yes, Magda, what a beauty! She was like one of the girls from Charlie's Angels, the blonde one.    Sandra: Yes, Farrah Fawcett, with the lovely hairstyle! I think Magda should have been a model, not a machinist!    Pat: Well, Sand, lovely to hear from you, please keep in touch about the reunion, or just for a chat! Bye!    Sandra: OK, Pat, hope to see you again, bye!\n",

Jamie: Hi Kate, as a matter of fact no bad experiences at all but it's been only four places so far. Two small hotels (one excellent, one rather disappointing but nothing exceptionally worth noting) and two airbnb flats: both rather unclean but positive in other aspects, all within the average. Why would you be interested?    Kate: Your well-being of course! :))    Kate: We had 'bad' guests stay last night, but it should be expected since it was New Year.    Jamie: A mad party?    Kate: I was woken at 2 am, then up at 3 am to tell them to be quiet.    Jamie: Sorry to hear about such a nasty behaviour. They should have known better, at the latest when entering Ballito Estate. Hope no damage?    Kate: No damage... Just too many folk in the room.    Kate: And a missing towel.    Jamie: Did they calm down after your protesting?    Kate: They did. But maybe I shouldn't have complained at all, should I? They are our bread and butter.    Jamie: I think no partying can excuse keeping people awake at night! Not even New Year is an excuse, especially in such places as your estate.    Kate: Bill was furious at them but too lazy to get up and talk them off. I don't think I'd have tried to cope with the noise on my own though.    Jamie: Good that you are paid in advance. One of our hosts told us a story of a wild party in his rented apartment that he tried to put an end to, but the people in it got aggressive towards him. Before he was able to call the police, they were gone without paying and leaving a total mess behind them.    Kate: So I can say we were lucky. Where was it?    Jamie: Cienfuegos, Cuba. I don't think he mentioned the nationality of the troublemakers.    Kate: Enough about bad experiences. We wish you only the best ones.    Jamie: And the same to you!!\n",

OMG baby clothes are terrific!    Alice: No offence, Agnes, but I think we should buy something more useful like a huge Pampers pack for example. I know that designer clothes are good quality and stuff but you know she won’t use them much and they will be too small in a blink of an eye anyway.    Agnes: None taken, Alice. I just thought that diapers are kinda impersonal and she won’t even remember who she got them from.    Alice: Sure, I get it. I just know that my baby shower gift turned out not to be very useful in a long term.    Kathy: Guys, how about some compromise?

We want to do something special for our friend and you’re acting like a princess, so unless you stop to do so, I’m going to call you this :)    Agnes: I won’t listen to this bullshit. Goodbye, Alice.    Jane: Did you just removed her from the conversation?    Kathy: Come on, Agnes, this was mean, but she just wants what’s best for Ursula.    Agnes: You want to add something, Kathy?    Kathy: No, let’s move on.\n",

Victor: My name is Victor    Vincent: What's your father's name?    Victor:  Dr. Noel.    Vincent: Your father is a doctor? but you chose to be an engineer. Why?    Victor: It's because I have no aptitude for medical profession.    Vincent: Don't you want to serve the suffering humanity?    Victor: Humanity is suffering in all aspects sir. So I have an equal opportunity to serve the suffering in my field.    Vincent: I can see you graduated in 2010. What have you been doing since then?    Victor: I'm looking for some proper job, sir.    Vincent: What do you mean by proper job?    Victor: A job where I could have an opportunity to exploit my abilities but not where the employer will exploit me.    Vincent: Why didn't you join a Government department?    Victor: The first thing is that Government has limited jobs to offer because of the world wide economic recession. The second thing is that in the Government departments both the idle and the ideal are treated in the same manner. The idle ones have no fear to be deprived of their jobs while the ideal have no hope for any rapid progress.    Vincent: Victor your CV shows that you have been a very bright student throughout your academic career. You have won many distinctions and have visited a number of countries. If you think you can't make any progress in Pakistan why don't you try your luck in  another country, let's say in America or England.    Victor: I didn't say that I can't make any progress in Pakistan. I am determined to stay in Pakistan and I strive hard to prove my worth. But sir I need a proper platform from where I can start my journey. And I think your company can provide me one as you appreciate qualification and not recommendation.    Vincent: OK  Victor I think you are the man we are looking for. Please, keep in touch. We will inform you within a week. Good luck.    Victor: Thank you very much, sir.\n",

Tom: Hmmn. Well I might have something to do on Wednesday afternoon for you, but it couold be done Thursday. Until then, it would be OK if you went off for a couple of days. If you can be on the phone at least?    Keith: No problem with phone calls. I will leave right away then.    Tom: Will you be taking the train, or?    Keith: I will probably drive it.

My dad stopped driving after his stroke and my Mum finds that these days she is just too nervous to drive.    Tom: That's not unusual, as we get older. How old are your folks now, Keith?    Keith: Dad's turning 70 this year, Mum's 67.     Tom: Well, that's not that old, really. But anyway I imagine that running a car on a pension is pointless when you have free bus passes and that.    Keith: Yes, but they do feel the lack of it when it comes to going to the garden centre and bringing back trees to plant or bags of soil.    Tom: yes, that's true    Keith: and that's what I'll be doing with them, improving the old garden a bit.     Tom: OK. Well, give them my regards.    Keith: Will do, thanks.\n",

      "Micky: Hello Birgit! Many thanks you the NY greetings. What was 2018 like for you then?     Helen: It has not been a good year for injuries, I'm afraid.    Helen: My bad back (bulging disc) I have had for 30 years now, and I manage it pretty well most of the time. As long as I keep fairly fit (especially my “core” muscles), it is not a big problem, as long as I don’t stand or walk slowly! I can run, walk fast, cycle, kayak, swim anything really, and all of these activities are good for me, but standing still is a real trial.    Micky: How can you manage everyday life without standing?!    Helen: Most of the time I can avoid standing, and have no problems at all, but it makes visiting art galleries and museums, and parties, a lot more difficult.    Micky: One can give museums a miss, but not parties. How about carrying one of these portable folding chairs with you?    Helen: Got one! But I feel silly with it.    Helen: This year I pushed to get a proper diagnosis of a hip which has been giving me problems on and off for 3 years. It proves to be in need of replacement..    Micky: You mentioned that at Robert's do. When do you intend to have it done?    Helen: Not sure but I did a lot of phoning round of friends in the medical profession (doctors, surgeons, physios, nurses etc – 14 of them). With one exception they all said to leave it as long as possible. I also spoke to about 11 friends who had had the operation. Every one of them said it was the best thing they had ever done, and to book it in as soon as possible! So that was really helpful!    Micky: Don't you have one surgeon with an overview of your bones' condition? I've got one myself since the first symptoms of arthritis.    Helen: My GP said exercise as much as you can, and if it hurts, keep taking the painkillers! So at the moment that is what I am doing. I have decided to give it a year, and see how the land lies then.    Micky: Sounds sensible. I refused that my knee be operated on 2 years ago and I'm still going strong.    Helen: Exactly! They operate much too often. As long as I can practise sport and have my activities filled holidays I won't get under their knives.    Micky: <file_photo> It's me in the gym the other day. Talking about operations...    Helen: My point exactly!    Helen: <file_photo> And me on a cycling tour in Morocco earlier this year. We shouldn't complain!    Micky: Chins up!\n",

Tonia: Yes, some 20 years ago! No comparison. He says it's much worse now. But he seems to enjoy every moment of our stay. Maybe with the exception of loud music all the time.    Carol: Do they party every night?! Is it live music?    Tonia: Everything! In Cuba nobody cares about such nonsense as night rest of the neighbours. It is noisy, and I mean NOISY, at all hours. People, cars, children, music, dogs...    Carol: That sounds exactly like our black folk here!!    Carol: It must be difficult when you plan your trips to predict a perfect length of a stay in one place. Which town was so bad?    Tonia: Havana Vieja. Add to the noise a narrow street, windows that can't be closed and the proximity to a major thoroughfare.    Carol: I got it! Like in a township.    Tonia: Are they so noisy? Can't remember really. Or, truth to tell, was never in any of them but only driving thru.    Carol: My domestic helper, who is black and obviously lives in a township, is always complaining that she can't sleep from the partying in her neighbourhood.

Carol: He's doing well, thank you. It's on the 23rd and he's not looking forward to it. But we are coping!    Tonia: Poor Charlie! Is he afraid of pain? Or of the complete anesthetics? Or complications?    Carol: A combination of them all, I guess. But he doesn't talk much about it and I don't insist.    Tonia: Right. Mark will be getting his op in mid February. Too early to even start being apprehensive.    Carol: You two just enjoy your holidays and make the most of it!    Tonia: Sure! After all it is Caribbean!

Peter: I am starting to get depressed about it.    George: Why?    Peter: The government have now used up 80% of the time available between the Referendum and the 29th March 2019 and have achieved precisely nothing.     Peter: I can't put my finger on anything, not one thing, that has been agreed and signed off on.    George: That's what they said. \"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\".     Peter: You know that Wilf Pareto, right?    George: The 80-20 rule guy?     Peter: Yeah, him. He said you can do 80% of the work with 20% of the time, and I suppose the government must be trying to prove him right, because now that's all the time we've got left.     George:  Problem is, I don't think we did the other 20% of the work with the first 80% of the time.     Peter: Don't even talk about it.    George: The issue is that May is useless and all the people in government have either no solutions or no ability to take command, and the EU negoiators intentionally sabotaged the process.    Peter: The simplest thing to do now would be to simply withdraw Article 50, stay in and make as much trouble for Merkel and Macron as we possibly can so that they wish they had let us go when they had the chance.

He had an emergency op on his eye due to retina displacement. 5 tears in the retina... As you can imagine we've now learned a great deal about the eye! LOL    Lilly: Oh my dear Olivia! Now thank you for the update on Bill, we are all worried then. A torn retina and a new operation. How did it happen??    Lilly: Exertion, sudden movement, weakened veins? What are the prospects? Please tell us more.    Olivia: There were 5 tears and probably caused by the cataract op. The doc is happy with the progress after a week of recovering the eye.    Lilly: Can Bill use the eye?    Olivia: He can see some fuzzy outline of objects. Colour is distorted, mainly green and blue.    Lilly: And what are the prospects?    Olivia: Progress will be slow up to 6 months of vision gradually changing. He has to to take things easy and only gentle walks.    Lilly: I suppose that suits him fine. Him always preferring a sedentary lifestyle.    Olivia: But one obvious torture: during this time alcohol, in any form, is strictly forbidden.    Lilly: How is he coping?    Olivia: Barely so. I gave up hope long ago. But so far he's been dry.    Olivia: At this stage the doc says his vision should return. This is encouraging.    Lilly: Fingers crossed!!

Tim: I don’t want to go! 😟😟    Peggy: Ok, that’s fine 🙄    Peggy: Maria is looking for a logistician to help her with conducting the workshops for parents on Saturday (10am-5pm). We would be forced to cancel the meeting, if none of you could participate.    Jada: I have my own workshops this Saturday 😒.    Tim: What would I need to do?    Peggy: Bring stuff, take it back, look after the participants. As always.    Tim: I’m going with my kid to the cinema. It’s her birthday. But I’ll ask Mark 😉.    Raphael: Where is it?

      "Erik: <file_other> Another portion of my photo collection: week 17 in China. Enjoy!    Maggie: Fantastic pics!    Paul: Incredible shots, Erik, you're doing an amazing job of capturing the everyday life around you.    Erik: It gives me much pleasure and I don't think there's anyone documenting their transitional phase.    Paul: You're making great use of the spectacle that surrounds you.    Charles: Clearly the notion of normality is arbitrary :O crazy good pics though    Dick: Great shots! The land of the free! I don't think you would be allowed to take pics of other folk's kids here...    Justine: I don't know why I get the idea that you're treating your photo subjects a little too much like objects... Every country deserves respect and I don't see we Europeans tend to treat them like zoo animals and document their everyday activities like some sort of National Geographic bit on monkeys...    Erik: Justine, believe me, this definitely not the case for me. I am merely trying to document the vibrant culture and yes, it sometimes seems bizarre to me but never in a derogatory way. I really don't see any disrespect in my photos.    Justine: That sounds like a typical capitalist attitude to me. And you give a nice, round answer there but there's always that underlying notion of superiority Europeans tend to exhibit towards Asians.    Dick: Erik, you really seem to have inadvertently opened a can of worms here ;) There are obvious differences between our cultures and I don't think that you're being offensive by taking pictures.    Justine: Seems to me there are better way of helping the locals progress than taking pictures of innocent bystanders in their daily struggles.    Maggie: I love how someone had throw in some unhealthy political comments into such an innocent conversation! Can't we just enjoy the pictures?    Justine: Maybe some of you can just turn a blind eye to social injustice everywhere but I am just too sensitive to walk by without a word.    Dick: I think you are definitely using your \"sensitivity in the wrong way. Just my opinion. \n",

Yeah, I think it went ok, what would you say Rob?    Rob: I can't remember anything. Panel blackout! ⚫    Hugh: Any annoying questions from the audience?    Rob: ⚫    Hugh: lol    Clarice: Well, I don't know what the guys think but I personally think the guy who chaired Rob's panel was a little bit of a dickhead, wasn't he?    Rob: 🔴 Yeah, a total dick. He did a nice round-up at the end in which he scoffed at our papers and basically said we were a bunch of silly losers. After which he asked us to provide a definition of politics, just to make sure we even understood what it was.    Clarice: @Hugh for your information, Rob is exaggerating less than usual    Hugh: Fuck, sounds insane    Juan: It was. But I actually had a very good time. Rob was the last one to answer the \"question\" and he gave a truly moving performance -of scorn and intellectual superiority 💖    Hugh: Ha ha ha how so    Clarice: Well, I don't wish to interrupt but I think it's not without importance that Rob actually began his answer by laughing the chair in his face    Juan: Sounds like a nice prelude 🎼    Rob: Indeed, that bit I really forgot lol. Anyway, I told him that as he has asked such a big question I was going to answer a few more. So I defined not only politics but also History, Art and Literature 😂😂😂😂    Clarice: And the best thing was that the guy actually seemed to enjoy the answer, even though it was apparent that Rob was mocking him from beginning to end. So weird...    Rob: I agree with Clarice, he looked me in the eye all the while, nodding with approval    Juan: Sounds really bizarre... So Rob, what's History? What's Literature? What's Art?    Rob: Oh fuck off lol    Clarice: You can purchase advance tickets for Rob for 10 EUR; tickets at the entrance cost 12 EUR    Rob: 😂😂😂    Juan: Rob sure deserves a glass of wine tonight    Rob: We all do.

There is no need to be angry, no is no, she has the right to say no.    Olivier: yes, she does...    Ian: I think she is generally panicked, like afraid of the divorce proceedings and she doesn't feel entirely entitled since she believes to be \"a fake Italian\".

Are there any positions not suitable for beginner's?    Faith: Well, yes, but this is a beginner's class and you can do as much or as little as you feel comfortable with.

I haven’t read everything just yet but I’d say read Gary Cross, “Kid’s Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood”    Donna: I think it’s interesting and also gives you a nice overview of the subject (which is what you desire 🔥 if you’re not planning on reading everything)    Keith: Yeah, that one is good. I’d also say read Regan    Keith: The titles goes along the lines of “War Toys, Movies … & Militarization”    Keith: It’s in the bibliography Mary gave us    Tim: It’s “War Toys, War Movies, and the Militarization of the United States”    Tim: by Reagan, R.    Keith: Oh wait… WAT??? 😹😹😹    Tim: 🤣🤣🤣    Donna: How confusing 😂    Agnes: I’ll remember the title and the author    Agnes: Forever    Agnes: Any other suggestions?    Tim: Well, it would be an obvious choice to read a couple of chapter from Mary’s book    Keith: It’s titled “Wounding Mars”    Keith: Or was it “Wounding Venus”?    Agnes: LOOOOL    Agnes: Guys this was an innocent question about readings for a seminar in cultural history, you can’t be treating me like this. I’m an adult student, I have a job, I have yet another job, I have a child    Agnes: Lots of them actually 👶🏽👶🏽👶🏽👶🏽👶🏽    Agnes: And I can’t read your JOKES for the seminar!!!!    Agnes: 🤣🤣🤣🤣    Agnes: To be fair I remember that one, it’s Wounding the World, right?    Keith: Yes 🤗 Catchy title, isn’t it?    Agnes: Yeah, I was actually thinking about it and thought that the initial Ws are supposed to make us think of World Wars    Tim: Yeah, that makes sense.

      "Jenny: Hello James, Molly told me that you are interested in applying for a job at Netflix :)    James: Hi Jenny! Good to hear from you. Yes, yes, I do. When I've heard that Molly has a friend who works there, I thought it may be a good idea to connect!    Jenny: It sure is. What would you like to know?    James: I'm interested in applying for Junior Project Manager position and I wonder what my chances are.    Jenny: Ok, may you send me your CV? It may be easier that way :)    James: Of course, thanks!    James: <file_other>    Jenny: Hm, ok. First of all, I'd change the format and the layout. I think it's better to send your CV in pdf rather than doc.    James: Ok    Jenny: As for the layout, you have some cool experience and I think the way its presented doesn't give you justice. Netflix is an entertainment company so maybe make it more entertaining? ;) You can use different colours, graphs, make it more visual, not only informative.    James: Cool, never thought about it!    Jenny: It seems like you are a down-to-earth guy which is probably good for a project manager, but at Netflix we highly value the creative side of people :)    James: Thank you so much Jenny! Will work on it.    Jenny: <file_other>    Jenny: Here you'll find some cool templates you can get your inspiration from.    James: Thanks! I was also wondering about the atmosphere at the office. To put it bluntly, do you like your job? :)    Jenny: Oh yes! A lot! Keep in mind that I'm in the marketing team, so slightly different story.    Jenny: But yeah, I think it's a cool place to work at. My team is absolutely brilliant, people are motivated, inspiring, so I really couldn't ask for more.    James: Do you know then anyone from the business team? It almost sounds to good to be true :)    Jenny: I know a few, they're a nice bunch as well :) There are some ups and downs as everywhere, some things that could be improved, so it's not perfect, but still good.    Jenny: Also, don't forget it IS a corporation and a big one on top of that :D    James: Yeah, that's why I'm so curious about the atmosphere, etc. I've only worked in small companies.    Jenny: So what made you change your mind?    James: I think it's time to try something different :)    Jenny: It definitely is! I think if you have an open mind, like to learn and work under pressure, you may like it. Fingers crossed!    James: Thanks! May I have a couple of more questions?    Jenny: No problem, happy to help!\n",

You'll like it    Martha: Give me a sec.    Peter: Sure    Martha: An interesting article indeed. I still think the whole idea of that conflict is a bit blown out of proportion to control the masses. Us vs them. In reality, both China and the US are capably of being fully independent.    Peter: I agree to a certain extent.    Martha: Elaborate please    Peter: The \"we have to create  a state of permanent threat for people to need us\" approach but as a historian I know everything works in cycles of war.    Martha: There are plenty of wars out there. And they are both so huge that their internal doings should be fully sustainable. Plus the US makes enormous profit on arms industry.     Peter: If you want profit from arms industry, you need wars. More wars = more profit    Martha: I just think the conflict wouldn't make sense from an economic standpoint. And as much of a crackpot Trump is, he realizes that.    Peter: We're talking about the same Trump who refused meeting with Putin at the g20 summit after Russia attacked the Ukraine?    Martha: I honestly believe they discuss their issues behind closed doors. Known each other for years.    Peter: Yes, but had the meet happened, he would've had to condemn Putin on an international arena. So he remedied the situation by avoiding it completely.    Martha: That doesn't matter. It's just PR stunts anyway. Mostly. And the US doesn't really care about Europe    Peter: They never have. But they have quite a large influence on Us policies    Martha: That doesn't really matter either. It's not the government who will decide but corporate lobbyists.     Peter: Yes but if they feel like they want to retain control they will just need an excuse to start something    Martha: Not without business support. It's all about making money anyway, what does \"power\" even mean anymore?    Peter: Power always needs conflict\n",

I did say from the start this was to build her confidence    Rob: Dave is normally really good often we take people out on motorways on first session as they are the safest types of roads, and in South Wales there are quieter parts he probably took her on    Caron: Oh its just that in our emails we do say that we start with quieter simple roads    Rob: We can start on quieter roads  but thats just a general list of things, and in reality it can vary from driver to driver. Sometimes quieter roads, can just be 1hr or less to get warmed up, other times a full session is needed    Caron: Ok I am going to email her to say that he will carry on in his own car for the rest of the sessions, it was only the last one she was going to attempt to use her own.. do we charge her the extra 20?

I just thought it would be beneficial for the both of us...]    Brittany: I like it! Okay, let's do this! :D    Chandler: Great!! :D Shake on it? *Offers hand*    Brittany: *Shakes* You've got yourself a deal, kind sir. ;)    Brittany: Although I might not have it ready for this week - there's a lot of stuff that I've got to take care off...    Chandler: Hey, chill - it's not prob. ;) Just send it whenever    Chandler: I'm seriously excited.    Brittany: *blushes* Oh, stop it you.    Chandler: No, seriously - I mean it!    Chandler: You're a seriously talented writer! Have you thought about writing your own book?    Brittany: Sometimes...    Chandler: You sreally should! :) btw, what would it be about?    Brittany: Thanks :)    Brittany: Well... ;) My idea is to write a story in a universe where there are four types of people: the superheroes, the villains, the side-kicks and the civilians. The main character would be a classic side-kick, who thinks he's really unlucky because he always gets into various embarassing situations (like accidentally stepping in dog poo, tripping at inoportune moments...)    Brittany: Except here's the plot twist - it's later revealed that during all those *unlucky* situations, he was actually saving someone from a villain without realising it.

The idea that love is life. Love has been equated with life. Especially for women, but not only, also for men. People can't imagine life without it    Kelly: Yes, but we love this dream of life that is love and love that is life    Ann: And this creates dependency, jealousy, frustrations, drama    Ann: It's not even a very beautiful dream to be with someone all your life. The promise of no change. Stability forever. It is what capitalism needs from us - 40 years of mortgage and marriage    Kelly: Ahaha, yes and that somebody will take care of us when we are sick.     Ann: Love is beautiful, intense, crazy and brief. And it was transformed in a long lasting good, a house. Something like this.    Kelly: But i think, or I suppose that we should be able to love for life potentially. We cannot approach love with a plan    Ann: Yes, sure, but a substantial group of people, not one. But the problem is that love is mostly approached with one plan. Being together, get married, etc    Ann: Or now, under the new regime of supposed sexual freedom, with the opposite plan: nothings lasts and love doesn't matter. But this is substituting an ideology with another, when we should just let it be.    Ann: Simply 😅    Kelly: Yes, I agree    Jenny: and most of all this myth of love as life is a disappointing lie that makes people suffer a lot    Ann: Yes, the dependency that it creates is horrible    Ann: I see it with my friends, it breaks my heart    Kelly: sounds sad\n",

I need some advice as I am planning to go there as well    Sheryl: Yeah sure, go ahead    Richelle: So, how do you find the university there? Is it difficult?     Sheryl: Honestly, it was quite difficult in the beginning with the language because everything is in English, but because I did a foundation year abroad as well, and I learned academic English, I was already somehow more prepared for what was coming next    Richelle: And what do you study?    Sheryl: I am in my 3rd year studying psychology !!    Richelle: Seriously? That's what I want to study as well!    Sheryl: Oh that's great ahah, I really like the course and the way they assess us with the assignments, all the topics seem to be very interesting and you end up doing a lot of research. I am sure you will like it too    Richelle: Cool! And what about people there? I'm asking because I am a bit shy 😞    Sheryl: Studying abroad is honestly a new world. You see people from different parts of the world, and the most exciting thing is that you actually have things in common with them. Although let me tell you you have to be very open minded    Richelle: Have you had any unpleasant situations there?    Sheryl: Yes, I have, unfortunately, when you are abroad, you start thinking about things you probably have never thought about before, things like stereotypes ..    Richelle: Wow... what happened?    Sheryl: I guess we, unconsciously, treat people differently or just make up our minds, even before we know them. But don't be scared, seriously! I was shy in my first days too, and I thought everyone looks very confident, but trust me everyone feels exactly like you in their first days    Richelle: 🙂 I'm really afraid and exciting of going to study abroad. And please tell me, is the living expensive there?    Sheryl: I guess it is more expensive than in Portugal as we have pounds, but groceries have almost the same prices    Richelle: Ok, thanks a lot! You helped me a lot! I will contact with you if I have any other questions! Enjoy your day!\n",

David: I will ask them when I call them. It is a normal working day in India right?    Samuel: Yes, we are working today.    David: And you say the cost should be about 5 dollars per Bible?    Samuel: This is the usual price, Sir, if you buy 100 at a time. It is a lot to ask from you, I know.    David: No no. The church here agreed to pay the money back to me, it just needs someone to use his credit card. No need to be grateful. In fact I am sorry that I have not done it still even when I promised it so many weeks ago. You have many people waiting to receive the Word of God.    Samuel: Yes, there are many people in India who don't have their own Bible, sir. In our church some families are sharing it, one gets it one day in the week and then the next family gets it the day after.     David: Wow! Seven families for one Bible!

Mousie: <file_other>    Joddie: NO!!! Why murdered?    Mousie: The bloke is obviously mentally unstable but what could've triggered it all off was the shitstorm created around the mayor by the gvt. When the official media say that he's bad then he must be also responsible for my failed life. This sort of thing.    Joddie: So there's no direct, personal connection between the two?    Mousie: Not at all! The bloke maintains he'd been maltreated in prison under the PO administration and while Adamowicz was PO, then he'd been responsible for it. Beyond any comment!    Joddie: Who said so?    Mousie: That's what he shouted still on the crime scene.    Joddie: Was he apprehended on the spot?    Mousie: <file_other>    Mousie: The murderer is a puppet, it's the background of his act that is threatening to our future. This ruling party is in fact responsible for Adamowicz's death, not a poor and deluded halfwit (sorry, man!). Adamowicz stood for all that this PeeParty hates: humanitarian treatment of refugees and migrants, tolerant rights for LGBT folks, more liberal abortion laws. You know, although I can't agree with some of his views, the PiS hateful propaganda against Adamowicz has always filled me with utter disgust and disrespect for Kaczynski.    Joddie: I can imagine that it's not exactly your agenda. But nothing to my mind justifies political assassination.    Mousie: Can't call it like this. It was in my opinion an act of a politically motivated madman, a psychopath.    Mousie: And you know what's so tragic in addition to everything else? It all happened during the latest charity concert of Owsiak`s Orkiestra! The PeeParty jumped immediately on this wagon and accused HIM of fomenting discord in our uniform catholic society. I feel like vomiting!    Joddie: Could never understand those who voted for Kacz and his private party!    Mousie: But there was no choice! You have no idea what a bunch of self-supportive buggies PO had become!    Joddie: Yes, I really no longer understand what's going on in Poland...    Mousie: After what's happened nobody does.\n",

      "Gloria: Hi Tony, meant to ask you about it for some time now. Will a possible Brexit affect your business?    Tony: In Britain the farce of Brexit looms over everything all day every day. It's going to affect us all in a most adverse manner. No doubt about it.    Gloria: I'll never understand why so many voted for it.    Tony: Nor will I. It is hard to believe that as a nation we have been so stupid as to vote to leave the EU. Utter and sheer short-sightedness.    Tony: When the French protest against their government, they do it on the streets with their Gilets Jaunes. We do protest votes against the government. I’m not sure which nation has developed the more stupid way to object to our government!    Gloria: But will you in your printing business be affected?    Tony: Dunno yet. Actually I've had very few commissions from abroad, so not directly. But we are all going to have less money in our pockets. So there'll be less interest in fancy printed matter.    Tony: But that will affect my holiday plans! And I hate that! The whole nonsense of exchanging money leaves me sick. I've always been out of pocket, no matter whether in Austria or France. And now with the pound going down the drain...    Gloria: We are hardly meeting any British tourists in Mexico now. One couple in Campeche the other day but they said they're attending a convention or sth.    Tony: That's what I mean. We'll be stewing in our own splendidly isolated sauce again.    Gloria: Don't worry. You can always visit us in Austria paying your pounds which we will then spend visiting you in England.    Tony: That's a good plan. But how about me visiting France or Spain??? Any family or friends there?    Gloria: Do you think the second referendum is an option?    Tony: Definitely. Those morons voted \"for\" out of ignorance, out of sheer lack of knowledge and understanding. Common awareness of economic and political consequences of Brexit has made a quantum jump in this country as late as in the last few months.    Tony: And if you ask me, the Irish border issue cannot be solved thru' any diplomatic channels. It either stays open, the way it is now, or we have a new armed conflict with no prospect of being settled.    Gloria: Hasn't it started yet?    Tony: Yes. I fear the worst.    Gloria: Oh Tony... So wretched....\n",

Afterwards I drove to your house to check the basement but everything's fine.    Victoria: Thank you Rhys. You're so reliable!    Rhys: Another thing. Your neighbour told me there was a huge red cat prowling in your garden the other day. I clean forgot to tell you earlier.    Victoria: Oh my God!! It can be Oscar!! When was it?    Rhys: I thought so. No idea when he saw him. He wasn't sure himself.    Victoria: Oh Rhys PLEASE !! In the basement there's plenty of cat's food, tins and stuff. And his bowls are there too. Could you please put them nicely out under the terrace roof? If it's Oscar, it will keep him near home. Please!    Rhys: I thought about it. But then if it's not him and you end up with some strange cat?    Victoria: I don't mind. I love them all. Will you? I know it's a bother but the very idea of Oscar coming back home after all these months and we're not there...    Rhys: Calm down Vicky! I'll do it. I liked your tom too.

      "Tessy: Good morning Harry! Just thought I'd drop you a line before disappearing to the other side of the world. At the moment I'm on the train to Frankfurt airport, then off to Cuba for 5 weeks. Can't wait to be there!    Harry: A very good morning to you dear Tessy! How nice you are in touch. So travelling again? Gosh, you've got stamina!    Tessy: I wonder myself. Truth to tell I'm slightly apprehensive. Never been to Cuba. Have you?    Harry: No, I'm not that adventurous but Maya was. Last summer with her boys. And I think she was very enthusiastic.But I remember no details. Why don't you ask her? She may have a tip or two.    Tessy: A bit too late now :)) but I will definitely contact her. Still she can give me a few good tips. Do you remember if internet is really such a disaster there?    Harry: Oh yes, it is. She was gone for 2 weeks and I heard from her twice: from the Havana airport when she arrived and on leaving.    Tessy: I see! My Super Mario boss is expecting me to be online all the time - just in case. LOL    Harry: What a charming person. Have you told him to fuck off?    Tessy: More or less. And hey how are you? Tied down to the ground?    Harry: I hate winter for that reason. But still had a fantastic flying season this year. Can't complain really. We've been thinking about a skiing holiday though at Xmas.    Tessy: Smashing! Where to?    Harry: Actually that's an adventurous part - to Israel. They seem to have some incredible slopes with topnotch infrastructure. A bloke from Notts Club was there last year and couldn't praise it too much.    Tessy: Funny enough I remember seeing their skiing brochures when we were there back in 2000. Sooo long time ago. By now it can be only better. Wouldn't it bit more on a pricey side?    Harry: We'll manage 2 weeks. And it can't be more expensive that Austria.Not to mention Switzerland. They're gone mad there, with all those Chinks and Russkis. Nobody else can afford it any more.    Tessy: Apart from royals in Kitzbühel :))     Harry: Molly has found out about a package, with the flight, full board, accommodation. You only have to pay your ski passes.    Tessy: And that's where they are making their money! And on apres-skis!    Harry: I can easily give a miss to a fancy apres-ski! Have you had any bookings? They surely have nice all-inclusive places in Cuba.    Tessy: Not at all! Otherwise prices are exorbitant. But those affordable ones always have horrible write-ups. Yes, I've booked all my accommodation. Airbnb, I like to support the locals :)    Harry: Very noble of you. But it's a bit of a tossup: you can get a superb flat or land in a rubbish hip. I definitely prefer hotels.    Tessy: I AM more adventurous. Anyway it is safe, Cuba is said to be very safe even for woman travelling alone.    Harry: And ravishing blonde on top of it! But be careful.    Tessy: STB you are.    Harry: What the hell is STB?    Tessy: Swet Talking Bastard. Anyway it was great to chat with you. I think we're approaching Frankfurt. So see you in January!    Tessy: And have a fantastic skiing Xmas!    Harry: Happy and safe trails Tessy!\n",

Jean: No, they're fine, he has loads!    Joan: Don't become an opiate addict will you, darling?    Jean: I'm not that stupid! I am very careful with medicines, you do remember that we were both nurses for 40 bloody years, don't you!    Joan: Yes, of course, but I know that when you're in pain it's easy to self-medicate and overdo it. Perhaps you should go to the Dr.    Jean: Maybe, if it gets worse, they're busy enough with real problems.    Joan: Well, just take care, that's all. How are Maisy, Harry and the kids?    Jean: Well, the two oldest have just started secondary and Idris hates it! The little ones are still in primary, getting on well, it seems. Harry may have to move to Scotland, though.    Joan: Oh, that's so far away, let's hope not!    Jean: Yes, but it's lots more money, so he is considering it seriously.    Joan: Well, I'm sure it'll work out for the best. Did Stella call in?     Jean: Yes, after church, she came in snooping to see why I didn't turn up, nosy bitch!    Joan: Well, since Ken died she's lonely and wants to chat even more, she doesn't come up for air!    Jean: You're telling me! She stayed for almost 3 hours, I had to tell her I had to go to bed to rest my back, couldn't get rid of her otherwise!    Joan: I'm the same, I do try and dodge her at church if possible, but she often seeks me out and I'm stuck for the whole morning, she insists on going to the Church Hall for coffees.    Jean: Perhaps we should try to find her a new husband! Your brother's a widower, isn't he?     Joan: Bloody Nora! Can you imagine having Stella as your sister in law! No, I don't think Bill will be up for that!    Jean: Anyway, must go start dinner, see you next Weds, hopefully, back permitting.    Joan: Rest yourself now, lovely. See you soon!\n",

She loves the water when we go on holidays, but they don't do swimming in school anymore until juniors.     Andy: Yes, that's a pity. School cuts, I expect. It's a lot better if they start lessons young.    Helen: Oh, I agree. She likes playing in shallow water, but is very nervous when it gets a bit deeper.    Andy: Don't worry, we have a beginner's pool here. We start the Tadpoles off there.    Helen: Sorry?    Andy: Oh, I just mean the beginner kids.    Helen: When do you have space for Caitlin to start.    Andy: Let me check, well, July is all booked up, so I guess it'll be the first 3 weeks in August.    Helen: How much is it?     Andy: Well, it's an intensive course, with goggles and floats provided, so very good value, really. It's only £150 for the beginner's course.    Helen: Oh! I see... that seems a little more than I expected.    Andy: Well, parents or guardians also get free hot drinks.    Helen: Right...Ok.    Andy: We all want the best for the kids, don't we?

I think I could take a bus.    Tara: And I already hoped I'll have a whole half of pizza for myself :D    Chrissy: You love to talk about food, but actually you eat even less than me.    Tara: Not my fault I feel full too soon ;(    Pauline: You're saying it like it's a bad thing. Take a look in the mirror! :P    Tara: But I really love food! It'd be great if I could eat more at once.    Pauline: And you'd probably stay as skinny as you are.    Chrissy: Right? It's not fair! I don't eat much but I'm still fat ;(    Tara: You're not fat, you moron! You look perfectly fine!    Pauline: And you've got boobs! And sexy hips! You know how much other girls envy you?    Tara: Exactly. I look like a coat hanger in every dress I wear.    Chrissy: I don't think I've ever seen you in a dress.    Tara: And now you know why :P    Pauline: Come on, stop it with the negativity, both of you. We're all pretty and sexy, and that's what we need to keep telling ourselves.    Chrissy: Sorry, but if you burn your pizza and then tell it that it's not burned, it'll still be burned anyway.    Pauline: Maybe, but I like pizza when it's burned :P    Tara: So you're saying that someone's gonna like us even if we're “burned”? :D    Pauline: Exactly!

Haley: True that    Nick: So what did you sacrifice?    Haley: Arcadia Bay.    Nick: Srsly?? I was 100% certain, you're going to sacrifice Chloe.    Haley: I mean it wasn't an easy decision, but it made sense to me. What did you choose?     Nick: I sacrificed Chloe, obviously.    Haley: obviously :P    Haley: You know it's almost 50/50 with this choice among the players    Nick: I've seen the statistics, yes. So why did you choose Chloe?    Haley: Because it's actually the one person that you truly care about. Who's like your best friend and means something to you. You've tried so hard for her and now you're just gonna throw that all away and kill her? I just couldn't do it.    Nick: Yes, but that's one life against several thousands of lives including Chloe's mother. How do you think that would make her feel?    Haley: I know and as I said it was a devastating choice, but I couldn't let her die after all that emotional build-up.    Nick: I sorta get it... in theory. But for me the math was simple. Plus there was this part where you had to see the damage the storm had done and save your classmates and all that. It really got to me.    Haley: I know all that but it was just... pursuit of happiness I guess. Like if it was Josie or your mom, what would you do?    Nick: yeah, but for me it wasn't a Josie/mom kind of relationship. Chloe and Max just spent several days together after some long years of zero contact. I just didn't really feel that close to Chloe, I guess.    Haley: I totally adored her and actually felt guilty a lot o f times on Max's behalf for abandoning her like that those years ago. I know Chloe is difficult and troublesome, but for me that was kinda lovable.    Nick: I didn't connect with her like that at all. I mean it wasn't ok, what Max did, but I feel like Chloe was constantly guilt tripping Max throughout the game. It was kinda annoying.    Haley: i dindn't really see it that way. Chloe's just sorta emotional, says what she feels.    Nick: That's a polite way to put it but ok. :P What about the other choices? And most importantly - did you water the plant? :D    Haley: Yes! :D I watered it exactly right.    Nick: Haha, me too. I wish I was able to do that in real life :P\n",

I just have to remember about the book before we meet next time.    William: Isn't it pretty soon? Hasn't Rita arranged for some meal together these days?    Susan: True! St Martin's Goose on the 10th! It is this coming Friday. Will you be as kind and bring the book with you?    William: But of course! Pleasure.    William: And you can keep it.

He did a nice round-up at the end in which he scoffed at our papers and basically said we were a bunch of silly losers. After which he asked us to provide a definition of politics, just to make sure we even understood what it was.    Clarice: @Hugh for your information, Rob is exaggerating less than usual    Hugh: Fuck, sounds insane    Juan: It was. But I actually had a very good time. Rob was the last one to answer the \"question\" and he gave a truly moving performance -of scorn and intellectual superiority 💖    Hugh: Ha ha ha how so    Clarice: Well, I don't wish to interrupt but I think it's not without importance that Rob actually began his answer by laughing the chair in his face    Juan: Sounds like a nice prelude 🎼    Rob: Indeed, that bit I really forgot lol. Anyway, I told him that as he has asked such a big question I was going to answer a few more. So I defined not only politics but also History, Art and Literature 😂😂😂😂    Clarice: And the best thing was that the guy actually seemed to enjoy the answer, even though it was apparent that Rob was mocking him from beginning to end. So weird...    Rob: I agree with Clarice, he looked me in the eye all the while, nodding with approval    Juan: Sounds really bizarre... So Rob, what's History? What's Literature? What's Art?

I'm in a very difficult position right now as I've just arrived in Barcelona and have nowhere to stay.    John: We are really sorry for the inconvenience, but you need to contact the hotel directly. We will do the same to find out what happened and why your booking was cancelled in order to avoid this happening again in the future.    Greg: But what should I do now? I've spoken to the manager and he said it might have been cancelled by accident. They don't have any vacancies right now and all options suggested by the local staff is well above my budget. Especially, as my budget for the accommodation is still frozen and I can't access it.    John: If your reservation was cancelled, you should receive the whole sum back. Please contact your bank to find out the time when it can be processed.    Greg: Thank you, but that doesn't solve my problem. Banks are already closed as it's past 8 PM. I'm currently standing in the hotel lobby with all my luggage with no place to go to. As I made a reservation on your website, I think you or the hotel should take the responsibility to provide me with an affordable place to stay.    John: I am sorry to hear that, Greg, but in accordance with our policy, we do not take any responsibility for hotels actions. The sum you paid should be reimbursed to you as soon as possible. We also will review our cooperation with the hotel, but unfortunately, we are not able to book for you a different place.    Greg: Great service indeed. So what should I do in this case?    John: In situations such as this, we strongly advise our clients to use our website to make another booking and always make sure that the reservation was confirmed by the hotel. If you are not sure whether your booking was successful, please contact the hotel staff directly.\n",

My vote is to just throw all T-day grocery charges on splitwise and charging everyone equally    George: I'm ok either way    Kieran: Also, dont include Ashley on the bill, she is not even here    Luke: our guests spent $45 on cheesecake and ice cream so if the totals are close to $20/person then probably not worth the trouble.

I guess my mum's put something in there    Jack: My attic is a real 'blanket paradise'    Jack: I've always wondered why my parents put all those blankets there, some were even hardly used...    Vivian: you see? each of us is able to help.    Vivian: there're so many things that we consider useless but which may actually improve some people's lives    George: All right!

Nadia: it's about this dude you're talking to/dating I don't know how to call it    Anne: doesn't matter, but what happened?    Nadia: he's not being honest with you. I was fighting myself whether or not I should tell you cause I got this information from someone else, but as you're my bestie, you gotta know the truth    Anne: ok, now I'm worried as fuck.    Nadia: do you remember when he was supposed to visit you? and then we saw him a few days later, on my birthday, with this Alexis in the pub?    Anne: yeah...pathetic but I forgot about this    Nadia: then watch this    Nadia: I heard yesterday that he was in fucking love with her and wanted to be with her, but she said no and that was even the reason why she's not at the university now    Anne: wait waaat    Nadia: yes, exactly    Anne: who told you that?    Nadia: Jason. He told me they spent some time on talking and he told that he was in love with Alexis and also had an opportunity to be with some other girl, but Alexis was better and that's why he chose her.    Anne: how could I be so naive    Nadia: I'm not telling you that to make you sad or whatever, but to make you aware of the facts. I was shocked too, to be honest. It seems that he was playing with you, trying to attract her at the same time.    Anne: I don't know what to say    Nadia: don't say anything, just get used to it slowly and think if there is any sense to continue that    Nadia: if this is worth your time and feelings    Anne: I'm so happy I can always count on you...if not you, then I guess I'll never know about all of this and live not knowing anything    Nadia: no problem, as you said you can always count on me. I just don't want anyone to fool you or something    Anne: how can anyone be such a jerk    Anne: I just don't fucking get it. I was always so good for him, if he wanted to date her, then why would he waste my time    Nadia: cause some people are simply like that, they don't care or they just lack this ability to think about others, unfortunately...    Anne: I'm really pissed off right now    Nadia: just don't do anything reckless and try to act as if you didn't know anything. cause if you don't, then he'll figure out that Jason told someone.    Anne: Ok, I promise I'll try.    Nadia: Just calm down and observe.    Anne: I will, thank you for everything, I really appreciate it.    Nadia: any time.\n",

      "Peggie: My dear Hettie, for your 47th birthday tomorrow I wish you all the happiness and joy you deserve! May only good spirits be with you and guide you through this world.    Hettie: Dear Peggie, how sweet of you to remember! Thank you very much.    Peggie: I thought I'd contact you today rather than on your birthday proper so that I don't interrupt any celebrations. Time difference and so on.How are you doing?    Hettie: Certainly you wouldn't interrupt anything. The only celebration planned for tomorrow is an evening meal with my son and his wife. And with Thomas of course.    Hettie: Thank you. We are fine. Just the usual routine, nothing special happening. And how are you? Must be ages since we were in touch last!    Peggie: Nothing of importance happens in a life of an old woman! Apart from occasional ailments and similar discomforts. Thank goodness I'm fine.    Peggie: Laura, my daughter, gave birth to twins in March, two lovely girls, and my son Simon has moved house to Derry. A bit too far for me to drive to see them but I understand it's been necessary for his career. They say I should also move closer to them but I'm not ready to sell my house yet. As long as I feel fit to look after it, I'll stay here. So that's my news.    Peggie: Would you remember old Mr Lars, my next door neighbour? Well, he passed away two months ago. A stroke, I heard. Such a nice person! And not that old at all. 86 or something.    Hettie: Congratulations and best wishes to Laura! So how many children have they got now? I've somehow lost count.    Hettie: Yes, I remember him. So sorry to hear about his death.    Peggie: With the twins four. It's Simon whose family keeps on growing. They have got five children and Adela, Simon's wife, says she'd like to have a baby again. Well... They can surely afford it so why not? They are a very harmonious family.    Hettie: I can understand that you don't want to leave the house you've spent most of your life in. It's such a beautiful house too.    Hettie: By the way, we will probably be moving house soon too. A real estate agent, in fact a good friend of ours, has found an old farmhouse in need of a major overhaul in the area close to the Grampians. I have always wanted to live there! What's more, Thomas will be able to continue his research work in the National Park. We are both quite thrilled and hope it will happen.    Peggie: Why shouldn't it, if I may ask?    Hettie: Sorry to be so confused about all these kids!    Hettie: It's a question of funds, very banal.    Peggie: I'm sure you can sort it out. Anyway I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.    Hettie: Thanks Peggie. And thank you for the birthday wishes! Always nice to chat with you - across the ocean.    Peggie: My pleasure. Aren't these electronic and digital gadgets wonderful? I'm so proud I've mastered the basic use of my smartphone. Very useful!    Peggie: So all the best to you and please give my regards to Thomas.    Hettie: Thanks a lot. Love!\n",

Jane: Maybe a little, but you can still use WhatsApp and so on.    Will: Ah, true.    Jane: Anyway, weren't we supposed to be discussing the project?    Will: Right, sorry about that.

      "Brenda: Hello bro, you've got an invalid sister. I fell in the bathroom and badly hit my side. Can hardly move now.    Andy: Good gracious! How did you manage that?    Brenda: The floor was wet after I had a shower and I wanted to shake the rug, moved too fast, slipped, and hit with a thump my left side below the breast against the edge of the bathtub. Took my breath away for a sec. I even yelled or groaned or gasped. Anyway I was on the floor, shocked. Absolutely shocked. I thought, so that's how it happens. But I managed to get up and didn't realise the pain until I stretched to put my nighty on. Oh bro... Horrible....    Andy: You could have killed yourself. Where are you now?    Brenda: In bed. But I can hardly move. It's very painful all over the body. SHIIIIT!    Andy: Maybe you should call in an ambulance? Are you sure you haven't broken something? A rib?    Brenda: No, then I'd be howling with pain. It's just the impact of the fall that has, I don't know, damaged the tissue. Whatever I have here. Fat I suppose. It has to heal by itself.    Andy: Can you breath normally?    Brenda: Yes. I can't take a deep breath though.    Andy: Can you touch your bruised side? Is it swollen? Red?    Brenda: I can touch it, not press of course, but stroke. No, it isn't swollen. The skin is as usual, no discolouration. But this will come later, I suppose.    Andy: Not necessarily. It might as well remain unaffected. I mean the epidermis, the skin itself. Though I'd expect it to develop a bruise.    Andy: Are you coughing? Coughing blood?    Brenda: God! No! I'll see how I feel in the morning. I just need a rest. I feel so rotten, bro...    Andy: My worry would be that you've damaged something inside you. You know, split spleen, punctured lung.That sort of thing.You just watch your body.    Brenda: Yes, I will. I understand what you mean. I thought so as well. Just see how I feel tomorrow morning. Fucking hell! I can hardly pull myself up.    Andy: If I were you, I would go and see the doc first thing in the morning.    Brenda: And he'll send me to have an x-ray. I can't bear the thought of driving or even walking.    Andy: Well, he can come to your place and you'll be driven to hospital in an ambulance.    Brenda: You stop scaring the shit out of me! I am not that invalid. It's just bloody painful but I think I'm in one piece.    Andy: I don't know Brenda. One shouldn't take it too light those falls. You may still be in a state of shock and are underrating your condition. Will you phone me first thing in the morning please? Still from bed? Luise is gone by 7:30, so you won't be waking anyone up.    Brenda: OK brother. I will give you a call. Of course if I'm still alive.    Andy: Sister!! Anyway I wish you a good night's sleep. Have a good rest!    Brenda: Thanks bro. Sleep tight too.     Brenda: And don't worry about me.\n",

Kim: I know that many would like to stone me for saying that, but I don't see that much difference with PC and it's faaaar more comfortable.    Frank: Even the graphics? I've heard you will never have the same effect on PS as on PC.    Kim: Well, it's true, but I mostly enjoy the plot, the mechanics etc, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on something.    Frank: Hm... interesting.    Kim: If you're more into graphics than you can always watch some videos on YouTube where people compare PC and PS, but, to my mind, the differences are minimal.    Kim: Also, if you really want to have amazing graphics you need quite a powerful PC, PS is more affordable.    Frank: yeah, but games are more expensive.    Kim: Not on Cyber Monday :D depends how much you play, it usually takes me quite a while to finish one.    Frank: I'm more an occasional player, so I don't if there's any point.

Kevin: Christ man! I'm so sorry, I had no idea.    Carl: Well, it's only been about 3 months. When we worked on the Green Acres site last year, she was still perfectly healthy.    Kevin: Yeah, that was only last summer. What happened? (if you don't mind me asking.)    Carl: Well, we went on hols last September and she had problems with her stomach, bloating, pain and such, then a bit of bleeding. Saw the consultant and she said a tumour in the bowel had spread to the liver. That was only November and here we are in February with her in hospital.    Kevin: Shit, man! That's tough. I'm so sorry. How is she really?    Carl: Well, she knows it's bad, but she's in denial a bit. She is so relaxed in the hospital, in discomfort, but not any real pain. They are total stars there.    Kevin: I'll tell Bernadette about it, remember that works do last year? They really got on well, she'll be so concerned.    Carl: She has meditation classes as well, which she finds marvellous. They are talking about her moving to the hospice for better therapy and care, she won't have more than a few weeks left now.    Kevin: Oh, mate, that's brutal. You OK?    Carl: Well, I'm thinking of Wendy mostly, she is coping so well. Course, I'm tired, only go into work in the mornings now, spend 1 to 9pm with Wendy, kids have been there a lot too, girls from the office, my sister in law has been brilliant. People just love Wendy.    Kevin: Maybe me and Bernie will pop in, do you think she'd remember us?    Carl: Yes, she knew you and me were friends and she did like Bernie too. Come down tomorrow, mate. Takes a bit of pressure off me too.    Kevin: Yeah, we'll do that, what time is visiting?    Carl: 7 to 9, I can come for longer cos I'm her husband.    Kevin: What shall we bring her?    Carl: Oh, she likes oranges and grapes, though she doesn't eat much now, maybe some books or magazines?    Kevin: OK, well see you there, oh yes, which ward is it?    Carl: It's Aneurin Bevan Ward on the 2nd floor, just ask at reception.    Kevin: Bye mate, take care and we'll see you tomorrow.\n",

Yours has been the most hospitable place of all we've had in Cuba.    Leon: You are too kind, Danny. And I mean what I said in my airbnb review: you two are the best and most memorable guests we have ever had in our Casa Leo.    Danny: We surely don't deserve so much praise :$ :$ :$    Leon: Thank you ever so much for your kind and generous write-up for airbnb!    Danny: You are doing a tremendously good job. Keep it up!    Leon: How is your stay in Trinidad? Have you found good accommodation?    Danny: Much to our shame I have to admit that we decided to stay in Las Cuevas, a state-run hotel. And that for a simple reason that airbnb doesn't list anything sensible and we didn't want to risk walking around the town dragging our suitcases and ask around for a room to rent. This hotel is just an easy option for us. It is quite OK, a bit too expensive, but in fact quite comfortable.    Leon: I know the place. They have been in operation for nearly 60 years!    Danny: Yes, we know. It was built as a motel for American tourist touring Cuba by car. But the politics had a different plan for them. Yet they seem to be doing fine with package tours.    Leon: And organizing conferences and similar things. They are quite famous for it. I hope their food is alright for you.    Danny: It's only breakfast as we prefer to eat in town. Every day a new place! Trinidad is absolutely fantastic for food with its choice of nearly a 100 restaurants. Pity so many of them are definitely too expensive for us. They are so beautiful!    Leon: Sorry to hear that. But a fancy interior doesn't mean necessarily good food, does it?    Danny: Not at all. We are absolutely happy with the place we've visited so far. The food was always excellent and the decor interesting. Very atmospheric places!    Leon: Glad to hear it. I wish you only good experiences for the rest of your stay in Cuba.    Danny: Thank you Leon!    Leon: Pleasure.\n",

Rick: Matthew, I only heard of positive effects of marijuana: relax, unwind, de-stress, relax, unwind, de-stress...

Gina: Always wanted to ask you: how old is Rose?    Mash: Not sure. My age? Must be older as she's bound to be getting her pension by now.    Gina: Has she retired yet?!    Mash: So I hear. ALTA secretary told me the other day.    Gina: And you, old man?    Mash: I get my state pension in 2021. But not having paid much into my pension plan I can't expect it entirely to support me.    Gina: And the estate? The rents?    Mash: That will do, though I'd have to cut on booze    Mash: D‑':    Mash: The smallholding is looking fairly neat these days (mainly due to Hellie). So I don’t work too hard there, but over the course of a year, I probably spend 4-5 hours a week working on it. Through butcher problems, we kept our pigs for a month longer than we expected this year, and in that time they grew by about 15-20 kilos each!. So my freezers are full to overflowing.    Gina: Pork is not good for you, they say. Especially for older folks.    Mash: We have decided to give the pigs a rest next year, since we should have plenty of meat. I really don't care if it's healthy or not as long as it tastes good.    Gina: Good old Mash!    Mash: It's me!    Gina: How grand to hear your news!     Mash: You must come and visit me again.    Gina: We'll think about it!    Mash: :)\n",

Luce: Have you and your oncologist considered these alternative therapies I wrote you about?    Tony: Oh yes! The surgeon says he won't consider doing nannoknife due to insufficient data available. It's early days for this treatment. But it was so successful with William, wasn't it?     Luce: Yes, a 100% percent. He's recently been checked for the markers and he's clean.    Tony: I suppose it just depends on personal experience of a surgeon. You had to look for yours too.    Luce: That's right. They are very traditional in Germany. I thought less so in ZA.    Tony: There may be other specialists in different parts of the country but we don't want to be far away from our house. He doesn't take travelling any more. And there are still these eye operations ahead of him. But one after the other.    Luce: Which one will come first?    Tony: Eyes. One and after a couple of weeks the other.    Luce: Keep us posted!\n",

Mark: I see what you're saying.    Sanjeev: The machines look better with decals.    Mark: Agreed. Not sure we should do it for all, though.

May I ask why you don't want it included?    Lydia: I just don't like the beer in my hand in this picture. I know it's a party, but I just don't feel comfortable knowing some of my co-workers might stumble upon it.    Henry: I understand completely. The picture's already deleted from the folder.

It's easier to split admin between more ppl    Marta: Also it's.easier when everyone watches everyone    Marta: Easier to spot mistakes    Szymon: In a perfect world, I would gain benefit from solo (ie. by managing the elements), but in reality it's just hard.

I'm so sorry I didn't reply earlier - I had a couple of trips going on and literally no time to check the Internet!!! :( Now my Inbox is stuffed with emails that need replying -_-    Mollie: Anyhoo, can I say how honoured I am that I got to see a sneak peek of the chapter (do you do this to all of your reviewers?? ;) ) and how much it made me want to read more! The chapter's lovely; I can't wait to see everyone;s reactions to Ian's presence in New York. :D    Mollie: One technical issue though - how on earth are you going to explain Ian's incredible late workload? Sorry, i'm just being picky... :P    Ash: I'm glad you like the preview! No I only give certain people previews. If their comments have really touched me then I usually try to show my thanks by sending a preview. Chapter 27 picks up a couple months after Ian and Roses reconciliation. Ian did work in certain parts, like all day in Little Talks and several others. But you are right that he is behind, and I will make a comment to address that! Gotta keep ya all happy!!! ;)     Mollie: Out of curiosity though, are you ever going to have Ian tell Rose about switching realities experience??    Mollie: You could always have that as additional chapter, or you could have a chapter showing everyone's reactions to Ian and Rose being toegther (that would always be worth reading! :P) Either way, you have fun writing :D    Ash: It's not my plan to have him reveal it. It was about the realization for Ian. About him seeing the truth that's always been there. I never felt that he needed to tell her about it. He just needed her.    Mollie: Awww, that last line *Swoon*    Mollie: But sure, it is your story :) You can do whatever you want :P    Mollie: What I keep wondering is what will happen to Ian once he reached 2025 in his own timeline, how will he react ect. Sorry for bugging you like this, it's all very interesting :P     Ash: I hope I didn't come across rude!!! I wasn't at all trying to do that!!! I've had that question before. It's all a bit timey wimey and weird. It's not like Quantum Leap where one replaces the original and the \"original\" is somewhere.    Ash: It's more of he was given this gift of jumping forward, so see what his life is/what it could be. But he had to make the decision if he was going to follow through. Was he going to make it happen, or was he going to give up the one thing in his life that made it precious? Was he going to fight for Rose? Was he going to believe that she loved him and allow himself that love? Paradox-y yes. Does that help?     Mollie: No, you didn't come off as rude - if anything, it made me think to myself: well done, you've just offended the author\" :P    Mollie: As for your explanation... er yeah kinda? I get why you did it for the plot (which also makes the plot more interesting), I'm just imaging Ian's reactions when he finally reaches 2025 and and thinks about how he woul have jumped timelines every day... am I making sense? Think of it as me creating a fanfic in my head of an actual fanfic :P\n",

Dad: Great :) The tree and all the decorations will be up by then :)    Donnie: I have a request, though. Do you think you can lend me $250? I'm a little short.

It was so peaceful and serene.    Dad: You know that it's actually up for sale now? But the owners have devastated the place. You can check for yourself. It's all on mls.com    Donnie: Really?? You can buy it again :)    Dad: I wish! They're asking for 100,000 more.    Donnie: Wow, real estate is going through the roof these days.

Anyway    Frannie: I'm listening (or rather reading)    Jim: A substratum or substrate is essentially a language that existed in a given territory before another language    Frannie: Ok    Jim: Then people speaking a different language arrived in that territory and slowly their language became the dominant one    Frannie: And then the older language influences the new one, right?    Jim: Yes. The substratum slowly disappears but leaves some traces in the new language (the superstratum) like some words, pronunciation aspects and so on    Frannie: Ok, so for example the Etruscan language was the substratum and Latin the superstratum, right?    Jim: Yes, and Etruscan influenced the local variety of latin in later centuries    Frannie: Ok    Jim: I have a question too    Frannie: You? I thought you were Mr. Perfect Notes    Jim: I am, but I missed two lessons in November    Frannie: Ok    Jim: So... what was exactly the story with the name \"Mediolanum\"?    Frannie: Ok, I know this one. In the ancient Celtic languages the Indoeuropean consonant \"p\" wasn't pronounced, for example the word for \"father\" was \"athir\" (vs. \"pater\" in Latin for example). So according to many scholars \"Mediolanum\" came from \"medio-\" and \"planum\" because there is no \"p\", so it's basically \"in the middle of the plane\".    Jim: Ok! Thanks    Frannie: You're more than welcome, you helped me too    Jim: ;)    Frannie: Good luck for tomorrow!    Jim: Godspeed!\n",

      "Sandeep: Sir, there are two monkeys loose in the factory. So far they have damaged the ceiling in four rooms. We would like to call an extermination service before they do more damage. Please advise.    Santakumar: This is terrible. Have the guards not been called?    Sandeep: Sir, yes, the guards have not been able to chase them out.    Santakumar: What have they tried?    Sandeep: They have tried getting them with food and tried setting off the fire alarm to scare them. Nothing has worked.    Santakumar: There must be something else we can do. Are the bay doors open?    Sandeep: The bay doors are left open for them to run out, but they are hiding in the ceiling.    Santakumar: Do we know where they are now?    Sandeep: Not really until they make a noise. We think they are in the Engineering offices.    Santakumar: Make sure they stay out of the test lab!    Sandeep: That is the fear. That they will damage valuable equipment.    Santakumar: How did they get in?    Sandeep: It is not known, but perhaps on a truck.    Santakumar: Well, if you have to call, do it today. Let me know the cost.     Sandeep: I will do it now.    Santakumar: And I don't want them hurt or killed. They must be safely relocated.    Sandeep: Certainly.    Santakumar: That's all we need is animal cruelty on our heads.    Sandeep: Seems cruel to keep them shut in a factory too but they aren't smart enough to leave.

      "Tim: So I think it's time to start preparing our presentation.    Samantha: Agreed. I've actually already done some research on natural selection. Just basic stuff like wikipedia but it cites some more serious sources.     Tim: ok, great. Do you want to focus on anything in particular? Because how are we dividing this project?    Samantha: I think I'd like to talk about the history of the concept - like what was before Darwin and then about his idea in the \"origin of species\"     Tim: I've actually just finished reading the selfish gene by Dawkins and I would like to incorporate some of the stuff from the book.     Samantha: Oh cool, was it good?    Tim: Great even. I've always thought it's a shame that he's mostly known as the chief atheist when he's really a brilliant biologist.     Samantha: I've always kinda associated Dawkins with the atheist stuff tbh I've only recently found out about his scientific work    Tim: Yeah, many people do that and it's a shame. You know that he coined the term meme?    Samantha: oh cool, i had no idea.     Tim: so it would be great to talk about he's ideas in the presentation     Tim: *his    Samantha: sure, you can talk about the modern understanding of natural selection and include Dawkins there     Tim: So I would give like the modern definition of it    Samantha: Yeah, seems like it. If you want.     Tim: sure, can do that. What else do we need?     Samantha: So we have - the history, the actual modern definition... maybe the evidence? We could mention like... you know, all the things they've dug up ;)     Tim: yes, the fossils and all that.     Tim: That's a good idea. And then maybe why it's important? Like how it changed science?    Samantha: oh, that would be good - why it matters when it comes to our understanding of humanity's development, origin etc.     Samantha: So you wanna take that part?    Tim: Yeah, could be interesting.     Samantha: So I'll take the evidence part.     Tim: Great. It seems evenly divided.     Samantha: Think so too. Btw are we making a power point or using some other software?    Tim: I was thinking Prezi it's much nicer.     Samantha: Heard of it, but I think I've never used it.

Theo: <file_other> \"Populism is usually described as a strategic approach that frames politics as a battle between the virtuous, “ordinary” masses and a nefarious or corrupt elite\".    Jimmy: Yes, but that's actually quite a lib-cons vision, because aren't we in a kind of struggle between an \"elite\" and ordinary people?

Theo: maybe you're right    Jimmy: it's not surprising that people want a change    Theo: The only stupid thing is that then they vote for Trump, Salvini and Orban    Jimmy: Exactly, so maybe we should call \"populism\" all the parties, politicians, movements that promise to address the inequalities and problems, but actually make them worse or focus on even less privileged groups (refugees, unemployed, immigrants, minorities) and blame them for the problems... which of course makes problems only worse    Theo: haha, that's a much better definition than that of the guardian, I think    Jimmy: hahah, thanks\n",

Now thank you for the update on Bill, we are all worried then. A torn retina and a new operation. How did it happen??    Lilly: Exertion, sudden movement, weakened veins? What are the prospects? Please tell us more.    Olivia: There were 5 tears and probably caused by the cataract op. The doc is happy with the progress after a week of recovering the eye.    Lilly: Can Bill use the eye?    Olivia: He can see some fuzzy outline of objects. Colour is distorted, mainly green and blue.    Lilly: And what are the prospects?    Olivia: Progress will be slow up to 6 months of vision gradually changing. He has to to take things easy and only gentle walks.    Lilly: I suppose that suits him fine. Him always preferring a sedentary lifestyle.    Olivia: But one obvious torture: during this time alcohol, in any form, is strictly forbidden.    Lilly: How is he coping?    Olivia: Barely so. I gave up hope long ago. But so far he's been dry.    Olivia: At this stage the doc says his vision should return. This is encouraging.    Lilly: Fingers crossed!!

Will you attend?    Ethy: Of course. I know his text by heart but I have to be at his side all the time. With medications etc.    Laura: I suppose he also feel more confident when you're around.    Ethy: Very much so. In fact we are together most of the time. It does start to sap my energies. But - no choice! Will you be attending?    Laura: Just told you we both would.    Ethy: Nice of you! Peter will be happy to see you. But certainly you know everything he's going to talk about.    Laura: Not exactly as he always finds out new details. It will be new to Ed though.    Laura: Shall we have a drink afterwards?    Ethy: That depends on Peter's condition. Only if he's not too tired. Then he'd only want to go home.    Laura: Sure enough. Just a suggestion. So let's hope the weather keeps and Peter's lecture will be well attended.    Ethy: I'm sure it'll be a success again. So I'll see you both at the cemetery?    Laura: Yes. Ta ta!\n",
