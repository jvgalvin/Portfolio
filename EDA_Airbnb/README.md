# Purpose
The purpose of this personal project was to conduct an exploratory data analysis.

# Date
This project was completed in March 2021.

# Context
This was conducted during the early stages of the Coronvirus-19 outbreak. I had moved back to California from New York and wondered how COVID-19 may have impacted the peer-to-peer housing market in New York City.

# Data
I used data published by Airbnb here - http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. I downloaded the listing csv files because I had not yet had experience with APIs at the time I performed this analysis. The data is comprised of all listing files from January 2017 - January 2021.

# Tools Used
I performed this analysis locally within Jupyter Notebook.

# Top Line Summary
The total number of listings in NYC plummeted during the initial stages of COVID-19. The mean price per night was affected to a greater extent in Manhattan than in Brooklyn, despite an equivalent drop in total number of listings in both boroughs.
