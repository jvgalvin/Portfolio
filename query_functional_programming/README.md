# Summary of Project

This is an individual project that I completed to practice connecting to a SQL database, writing SQl queries, and visualizing data from these queries in a business user-friendly format. The output of this project is a series of recommendations for a fictional business, all of which are derived from data.

## Tools Used

I used a PostgreSQL database comprised of several tables containing synthetic sales and product data for a fictional meal prep and delivery business. I wrapped SQL with Python to connect to PostgreSQL and return the results of the queries as individual data frames. For subsequent manipulation, I utilized Pandas and visualized plots using Matplotlib.

## Environment

I completed this project exclusively from a VM running on AWS within a docker cluster of anaconda and postgres containers. I used a Jupyter Notebook server within this cluster to work within the notebooks contained in this repository.
