    "It is my understanding that AGM does not want to give its customer data to Peak Deliveries during the proof of concept phase. Instead, customers will sign up independently with Peak through Peak's website, app, or telephone help line in order to have AGM meals delivered. I recommend we continue this practice and withhold our customer data from Peak.\n",

    "We anticipated prior to the PoC that there would not be a perfect match of customer first names, last names, and addresses between our records and those maintained by Peak. While not all of Peak's customer records match perfectly with our own, the mismatch is relatively small and manageable. More specifically, roughly 13% of the customer records have at least one mismatch. Additionally, the mistakes appear to be correctable. We used fuzzy logic to validate that the Peak names and addresses we were provided are \"close enough\" to our own that we could use available algorithms to correct them (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are relatively few mismatches and they are fixable, I see no reason to provide our customer data to Peak. Providing this data could be a risk for AGM if Peak were to use it to recommend alternative, nearby meals or restaurants to our customers, which would undoubtedly negatively impact our revenue potential. The most significant drawback of not providing this data to Peak is an impact on our customer experience. Without us providing Peak with their data, they need to manually provide it themselves to Peak. We have no data to suggest, however, that this manual process would cause a customer not to sign up for AGM delivery via Peak."
